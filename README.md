# Grading

## Grading breakdown

```
  60% = 6 assignments x  10% each
+ 40% = 4 quizzes     x  10% each
  ----
= 100%
```

**Assignments**: 
- Due date: assignments are due 11:59pm on the designated Monday.
- Content: each assignment contains several tasks which will correspond to the lab practice questions done in class.

**Quizzes**: 
- Due date: quizzes will be open at 8:30am on the desingated Tuesday and is due within 24 hours at 8:30am the next day Wednesday; 
  - all quizzes will be open for 24 hours on Canvas to accomodate students in different time zones.
  - You have to start the quiz on Canvas on or after 8:30am on the Tuesday and submit the quiz. 
  - After you start the quiz, you have 1 hour to do the quiz but the quiz must be submitted before 8:30am on the Wednesday. THIS IS IMPORTANT, this means that you only have 1 continuous hour to do the quiz, but you can do choose when to do that 1 hour as long as you START and FINISH the quiz within that 24 hours.
    - e.g. if you started your quiz at 8:45am Tuesday, you have until 9:45am Tuesday to submit it; 
    - e.g. if you started your quiz at 8:00am on the next day Wednesday, you will have to submit your quiz before 8:30am.
- Content: the content examined in the quizzes are cumulative.
- Students must safely pass at least 3 out of the 4 quizzes to safely pass the course; "safely pass" here means C- or above.

## Late polocy

Assignments will all be due on Monday 11:59pm. If the assignment is submitted within 24 hours after the due date, students can get a maximum of 50%, assignments won't be graded after 24 hours of the due date. This is to ensure that all the assignments would be marked and given back to you in a timely manner.

Quizzes cannot be submitted late (i.e. after the 24 hours  at 8:30am on the Wednesday), there is a 24 hour leeway so use that wisely ;).


# Academic Honesty

See [student services: academic integrity](https://www.sfu.ca/students/academicintegrity.html) for details.

**Independent work**: all assignments and quizzes is to be done independently. This course is a safe space for you to practice coding; because in the future, you will be expected to learn coding independently a lot (speaking from experience).

**Citation**: if you plan to use code not provided to you in class, please cite it (e.g. link it!). Not only is this an academic honesty requirement, citing also helps you understand what you did when you need to use your code again in the future.

The internet is your friend, we encourage you to search up solutions for whatever problems you may be having. We almost never code from scratch, we almost always have a reference; so please do use the examples in class and search up your questions online!

We all feel anxious learning something new at first. Believe in your self, and always remember, practice makes perfect.
