- Lab hours: this is a time for students to do the weekly assignments and ask questions. Everyone will be in the "main room", questions will be asked in chat; if you wish to have a short 1-on-1, we will go into a breakout room.
- Office hours: this is a time for students to ask TA's questions.

# Grading

## Grading breakdown

```
  50% = 8 weekly assignments x  6.25% each
+ 50% = 5 biweekly quizzes   x 10%    each
  ----
= 100%
```

**Assignments**: 
- Each assignment contains several tasks.
- An optional bonus assignment will be given at the end; only your top 8 scoring assignments will be counted towards your grade.
- Some assignment will have bonus tasks for bonus marks; but remember that assignments will still account for a maximum of 50% of your grade.

**Quizzes**: 
- All quizzes are take-home. They will be open for 24 hours on Canvas to accomodate students in different time zones; all students must complete the quiz within the desginated 24 hours. 
- Students must pass at least 3 out of the 5 quizzes to pass the course; "pass" here means C- or above.

No late assignments or quizzes will be accepted unless a substantial and valid reason is given --- but remember, we only take your top 10 scoring assignments!

# Academic Honesty

See [student services: academic integrity](https://www.sfu.ca/students/academicintegrity.html) for details.

**Independent work**: all assignments and quizzes is to be done independently. This course is a safe space for you to practice coding; because in the future, you will be expected to learn coding independently a lot (speaking from experience).

**Citation**: if you plan to use code not provided to you in class, please cite it (e.g. link it!). Not only is this an academic honesty requirement, citing also helps you understand what you did when you need to use your code again in the future.

The internet is your friend, we encourage you to search up solutions for whatever problems you may be having. We almost never code from scratch, we almost always have a reference; so please do use the examples in class and search up your questions online!

We all feel anxious learning something new at first. Believe in your self, and always remember, practice makes perfect :)
