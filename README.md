# Grading

## Grading breakdown

```
  60% = 6 assignments x 10% each
+ 40% = 4 quizzes     x 10% each
  ----

```

**Assignments**: 
- Due date: assignments are due 11:59pm on the designated Monday; they will open on the dat the associated lab starts.

  - all quizzes will be open for 24 hours on Canvas to accomodate students in different time zones.
  - You have to start the quiz on Canvas on or after 8:30am on the Tuesday and submit the quiz. 
  - After you start the quiz, you have 1 continuous hour to do the quiz but the quiz must be submitted before 8:30am on the Wednesday. 
  - In other words, you have 1 continuous hour to do the quiz, but you can do choose when to do that 1 hour anytime within the given 24 hours.
    - e.g. if you started your quiz at 8:45am Tuesday, you have until 9:45am Tuesday to submit it;

## Late policy

Assignments will all be due on Monday 11:59pm. If the assignment is submitted within 24 hours after the due date, students can get a maximum of 90%, if the assignment is submitted within 48 hours after the due date, students can get a maximum of 80%, etc. i.e. you will get a maximum of \[100% - (days late)x10%\] for a minimum of 0% on the assignment!

If you submit your assignment late though, we may not be able to mark it in a timely manner :(.

Quizzes cannot be submitted late (i.e. after the 24 hour period from 8:30am Tuesday to 8:30am on the Wednesday), there is a 24 hour leeway so use that wisely ;).


# Academic Honesty

See [student services: academic integrity](https://www.sfu.ca/students/academicintegrity.html) for details.

**Independent work**: all assignments and quizzes is to be done independently. This course is a safe space for you to practice coding.

**Citation**: if you plan to use code not provided to you in class, please cite it (e.g. link it!). Not only is this an academic honesty requirement, citing also helps you understand what you did when you need to use your code again in the future.

The internet is your friend, we encourage you to search up solutions for whatever problems you may be having. We almost never code from scratch, we almost always have a reference; so please do use the examples in class and search up your questions online!

We all feel anxious learning something new at first. Believe in your self, and always remember, practice makes perfect.
