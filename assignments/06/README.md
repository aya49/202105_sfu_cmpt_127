# Assignment 06: Make your own C cheatsheet

Due: 2021-08-02 11:59pm.

**REMEMBER**:
- Reference the [labs](../../labs), their practice problems, and the [assignments](../) for content!
- Assignments are to be done individually.
- You may submit/resubmit the assignment as many times as you need before the designated due date (please don't do it too often though).
- The internet is your friend :) Search for documentation online and make sure to understand why things work the way they do!

Your assignment will be graded according to this [**marking rubric**](#marking-rubric).

**REQUIREMENT**: you will create a cheatsheet and submit it as a PDF file `cheatsheet.pdf`.
- your cheatsheet should fit on a 2-sided A4 sheet.
- your font size should not be smaller than 10 pt.
- you cheatsheet should succinctly describe the C code syntax (with your own code examples where appropriate) and concepts from each lab (except for those in sections titled "bonus material", these are optional).

Be creative with how you organize and format your cheatsheet, make it personal. It will also be helpful for when you do the final quiz.

Your cheatsheet will be graded based on completeness i.e. it should be comprehensive. Ask yourself, if you end up not using C for the next three year, would you be able to pick it up again when you read your cheatsheet?

# Submission

Upload `cheatsheet.pdf` onto to the appropriate assignment submission page on the [CMPT 127 D100/D200/D300 Canvas page](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/62984) > Assignments.
