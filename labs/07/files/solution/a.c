// tip #1: write down what you know (problem) (program framework)

input: 
- a file or a text stream
behaviour:
- printf's for each letter, the alphabet of times it appears in the file divided by the total number of letters.

example:
$ ./p3.2
aaab
a 0.7500
b 0.2500



#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    // read a character from a text stream
    getchar() 

    return 0;
}
