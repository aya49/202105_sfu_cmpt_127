[Pieter Cornelis Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) was a Dutch painter. He evolved a non-representational form which he termed [neoplasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl). This consisted of white ground, upon which he painted a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and the three primary colors.
