week 03 2021-05-25
- introduction to C vs C++
  - compiled language > object code (remove comments, > assembler code .c > binary code .o > link binary code to other binary codes)
  - C is strongly typed (all variables have type defining how they are stored in memory and how they are represented in code: sizeof())
    - [intprintf(constchar*format,...)] printf("ascii: %d, character: %c")
  - variables store addresses of a space in memory that holds other variables?
    - inti= 0; printf("Address of iis %p\n",&i); # &i is the address
  - read in formatted inputs (standard in) (default is )
    - [intscanf(constchar*format,...)] scanf("%d",&i); #&i is address where value should be stored; returns number of stored variables
  - conditions: if/else Boolean expression: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=; logical operations: &&, ||, !
  - loops: repeat code; while, do-while, for (initialize; boolean; modify); break, continue (don't use if don't have to, hard to trace)
  - Google, http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/, https://en.cppreference.com/w/c
- 01.1 software development process (req, design, code, test), use internet
- 01.2 task 1.9 summary
- 01.3 gitlab
- 01.4 academic dishonesty

week 04 2021-06-01
- introduction to C continued
  - function declaration, definition
    - function (name, parameters, return value): reusable piece of code; call functions, function call functions/themself, store in different files (black box)
  - header files, implementation files
  - arrays
    - in C
    - as function parameters
  - arguments for program
  - algorithm analysis
  - arithmetic
- 02.1 weekly workflow: lecture, lab task, repo
- 02.2 tips: 
  - task 1: split code into many files
  - task 5: contains; look up C library string.h
  - task 6: create a function
  - task 8: don't do 26 if statements, one for each letter
  - task 10: two points of a rectangle
- lab quiz 1 (about)

  - task 1-4
- 08.2: memory allocation strategies (3) how long it takes to append to array with these 3
  - Big O amortization

week 13 2021-08-03

week 14 2021-08-10
- lab quiz 4

- 


add problem pseudocode
every other week programing

canvas might be better for quizzes within 24hr
